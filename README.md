# Bear-and-Steady-Gene-algo-m
The function uses a sliding window to find the smallest substring that can be replaced so that the remaining gene has each nucleotide appearing at most n/4 times.
It moves the window across the string, shrinking it whenever the rest of the gene meets the steady condition, and tracks the minimum length.
